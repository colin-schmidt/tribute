      <h3 id="timeline-title">A brief history of Johnson's life and professional accomplishments:</h3>
      <div id="tribute-info">
          <ul>
            <li><strong>1949</strong> - Lonnie George Johnson was born on October 6, 1949, in Mobile, Alabama.</li>
            <li><strong>1968</strong> - Johnson represented his school at a 1968 science fair sponsored by the Junior Engineering Technical Society (JETS), which took place at the University of Alabama at Tuscaloosa. The only black student in the competition, Johnson debuted a compressed-air-powered robot, called “the Linex”. Johnson won first prize.</li>
            <li><strong>1973</strong> - Johnson attended Tuskegee University on a math scholarship. He earned a bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering in 1973, and two years later he received a master’s degree in nuclear engineering from the school.</li>
            <li><strong>1979</strong> - Johnson moved on to NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in 1979, working as a systems engineer for the Galileo mission to Jupiter and the Cassini mission to Saturn, before returning to the Air Force in 1982, where he worked until 1987.</li>
            <li><strong>1982</strong> - One night, Johnson was conducting some experiments in 1982 and attached some nozzles to his bathroom sink.  When he opened the nozzles a powerful stream of water shot straight into the bathtub. Johnson’s instantaneous and instinctive reaction was that it would make a cool water gun.</li>
            <li><strong>1989</strong> - After seven years of tinkering and tireless sales-pitching, Johnson finally sold his device to the Larami Corporation. The “Power Drencher” had strong initial sales only through word of mouth, but after introducing large marketing efforts and a name change, the “Super Soaker” became a massively successful item.</li>
            <li><strong>1991</strong> - Selling between $10 to $60 depending on the model, the Super Soaker took off, generating $200 million in sales in 1991, and went on to annually rank among the world’s Top 20 best-selling toys.  Shortly after making the deal for the Super Soaker with the Larami Corporation, Larami became a subsidiary of Hasbro Inc.</li>
            <li><strong>1996</strong> - Johnson came up with another idea: replacing the water in the Super Soaker with a “toy [Nerf] projectile.” In 1996, Johnson received a patent for “Pneumatic launcher for a toy projectile and the like.” The technology Johnson invented for Nerf toy guns have generated millions for Hasbro and Johnson.</li>
            <li><strong>2003</strong> - With the creation of the Johnson Thermoelectric Energy Converter (JTEC), the engineer aimed to develop an advanced heat engine that could convert heat into electricity with more than twice the efficiency of existing methods. He believed once successful, the JTEC technology would be competitive with coal, petroleum, and natural gas, fulfilling the dream of efficient, renewable energy. The JTEC was named by Popular Mechanics as one of the top 10 world changing inventions of 2008.</li>
